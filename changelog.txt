v4.2.4

- Changed the fabric api id in the fabric.mod.json to use the newer 'fabric-api' id
- Disabled the animation computation optimisation added earlier in 4.2. There's just too many edge cases with shaders, making it impractical to keep for now
- Fixed a bug causing animated textured objects glitching out when multiple are present. Unfortunately this requires that animated textures not be unique timings per object =/
- Fixed some more compat issues with shaders and optifine
